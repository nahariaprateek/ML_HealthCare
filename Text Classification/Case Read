*Medical Text Classification for Disease Category Prediction*

Electronic health records contain vast amounts of unstructured clinical text. The efficient categorization of these medical texts by disease type is crucial for hospital information management, 
clinical research, and automated decision support systems. 
Accurate classification can improve patient care by enabling faster information retrieval and supporting clinical decision-making.

You are working as a data scientist for a healthcare technology company. 
Your task is to build a natural language processing model that can classify medical texts into different disease categories based on their content.
These classifications will help healthcare providers organize clinical documents, support medical coding, and enhance clinical decision support systems.

Column name Column description
text_id Unique identifier for each text sample
text    Medical text content (clinical notes, reports, etc.)
word_count  Number of words in the text
readability_score   Measure of text complexity (0-100)
keywords    Common medical terms extracted from the text
category    Disease category classification (target variable)
The disease categories include:

Cardiovascular
Respiratory
Gastrointestinal
Neurological
Endocrine
Musculoskeletal
Dermatological
Infectious
Evaluation Metric

The models will be evaluated using a weighted F1 score, which accounts for class imbalance in the dataset:

score = 100 * f1_score(actual, predicted, average='weighted')
